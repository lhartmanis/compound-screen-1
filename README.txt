This repository is associated with our study "Deciphering direct transcriptional effects of epigenetic compounds by large-scale new RNA profiling" by Hartmanis et al.

We will upload all code for processing 4sU labelled RNA, for both single-cell and bulk cell population experiments, and code for key analyses performed in our study.

Folder structure:
- Temporal_assignments: will contain code for inference of new and pre-existing RNAs for mini-bulk data based on the 4sU induced base conversions.
- Bursting: contains code for inference of transcriptional bursting kinetics from scRNA-seq data
- Differential_expression: contains code for DESEQ2 differential expression testing.
